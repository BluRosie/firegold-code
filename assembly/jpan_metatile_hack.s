@ the whole headbutt tree system
@ it implements jpan's behavior byte hack as well as the headbutt system in the space that the old routine took up.  when he said it was overly inefficient, he meant it!
@ compile this and then go to the offset 0x806D1F0 in the resulting .bin output.  copy everything there until the next block of zeros.  paste it to offset 0x6D1F0 in your rom.
@ there are various parameters you can play around with.  most of these are primarily the tables halfway through this.
@ i tried to comment it throughout!

@ now, in amap, there's the one field that is primarily used in wild encounter spots.  it's 2 when wild grass and 4 when surfing on water encounters.
@ because we won't be walking on the headbutt tree, we can use this field to our advantage.
@ cur_mapdata_block_get_field_at(s16 x, s16 y, u8 field) references a bunch of other routines, but eventually, it boils down to a bunch of preset fields or with the header info.
@ the first is 0x1FF, or the 9 least significant bits.  this is the behavior byte itself.
@ the second is 0x3E00, or the next 5 bits in terms of significance.  this allows for 2^5 (32) bits for use for our table.
@ note that the entry entered in this table should be multiplied by 2 because of the way that amap (incorrectly) displays the data.  this allows the code below to reference it properly.
@ screens are given in the post.

@ this assembly routine is a modded version of jpan's behavior byte hack that decreases space required for the table while slightly increasing what's needed for the code
